#I have been facing this issue for the few months. But finally, I got this awesome article available on web focusing deeply on resolving the issue.
First of all, it's really important to know the exact problem. Mine problem was :- 
1- "I was uable to access internet in my ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Although, I am connected to internet
& it's also showing no internet. That little question mark(?) over my wifi symbol was quite annoying"

2- If the problem doesn't resolves, try to remove all the extra extensions that you've install for improvising it's appearance. Like in my case:-
I have changed my ubuntu look to MacOs BigSur
