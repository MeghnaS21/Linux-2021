#I was unable to access internet in my Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Tried so many ways available on youtube to fix that but nothing could help.
#I have been facing this issue for the few months. But finally, I got this awesome article available on web focusing deeply on resolving the issue.
First of all, it's really important to know the exact problem. Mine problem was "I was uable to access internet in my ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Although, I am connected to internet
